# A short explanation of what this is in poem form
Once upon a time there was programmer.

He tried being all cool and independent.

And had too little time for couplings loose.

<br/>

But one day he fell ill.

And the doctor asked him, 

"Would you like some morphine for your coding blues?"

<br/>

And there it was.

He was Dependent.

On an Injection.

<br/>

Yes!

<br/>

The end.

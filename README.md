# A short explanation of what this is in poem form
Once upon a time there was programmer.
He tried being all cool and independent.
And had too little time for couplings loose.

But one day he fell ill.
And the doctor asked him, 
"Would you like some morphine for your coding blues?"

And there it was.
He was Dependent.
On an Injection.

Yes!

The end.
